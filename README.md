# Augury Demo application

You will need to have [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed.

To run a demo, clone the repo and `cd` into a demo project folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rangle/augury-examples.git
cd augury-examples
```

To run the input-output demo for example, type:

```sh
cd input-output
ng s
```

Open the Chrome browser and in the address-bar, enter: `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Demo Applications

The following demo applications should be used while reading the [Augury Guide](https://augury.angular.io/pages/guides/), to follow along. Each demo app isolates an Angular concept to play with.

* dependecy-injection
* forms
* input-output
* modules
* routes

There is also the Kitchen Sink demo app, which is an older app, but can still be used to quickly demo Augury features.
