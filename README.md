# Augury Demo application

You will need to have [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed.

To run a demo, clone the repo and `yarn start` demo project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rangle/augury-examples.git
cd augury-examples
```

First time you will need to install dependencies by running:

```sh
yarn install
```

To run the demo, type:

```sh
yarn start
```

Open the Chrome browser and in the address-bar, enter: `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Demo Applications

The following demo applications should be used while reading the [Augury Guide](/pages/guides/index.html), to follow along. Each demo app isolates an Angular concept to play with.

- dependecy-injection
- forms
- input-output
- modules
- routes

There is also the Kitchen Sink demo app, which is an older app, but can still be used to quickly demo Augury features.
